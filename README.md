# FakeChair - Bachelor thesis Project

A conference management and review tool on the Ethereum testnet Rinkeby. 

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites for local development

What things you need to install the software and how to install them.

Get the project:

```
$ git clone https://gitlab.gwdg.de/f.buschendorf/fakechair 
```

This Project uses the node packet manager:

```
$ sudo apt-get install npm 
```
The dapp is build using the dapp framework *Truffle*:

```
$ npm install -g truffle 
```

Install MetaMask, a browser add-on to interact with an Ethereum blockchain via dapps:

* [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/)


Download and install Ganache, a lokal Ethereum blockchain:

* [Ganache](http://truffleframework.com/ganache/)

Download and install IPFS, a peer-to-peer file storage system:

* [IPFS](https://ipfs.io/docs/getting-started/)

Go into the project folder, you will find ''package.json''. Install all dependencies. npm will look at the dependencies that are listed in that file and download the latest versions, using semantic versioning.

```
$ npm install
```

### Run local dapp

Start Ganache on port 7545.

Start IPFS daemon:

```
$ ipfs daemon 
```

**In project folder**

Compile and migrate contracts to the local blockchain:

```
$ truffle migrate --reset 
```

Run node:

```
$ npm run start 
```

Log in to MetaMask, copy the mnemonic and import it to MetaMask. This will enable the accounts generated by Ganache (see [Truffle Pet-Shop tutorial](http://truffleframework.com/tutorials/pet-shop)). Set MetaMask to the local rpc server: **http://127.0.0.1:7545**

In your browser the dapp should now be running and working. 

## Running the tests

There are only a few automated tests for this system.

```
truffle test
```
